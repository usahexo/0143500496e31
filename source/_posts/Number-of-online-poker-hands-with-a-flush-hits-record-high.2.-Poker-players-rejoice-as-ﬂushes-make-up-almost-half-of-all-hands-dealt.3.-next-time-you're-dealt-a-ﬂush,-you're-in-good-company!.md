In the second quarter of this year, the number of online poker hands with a ﬂush hit a new high. This is good news for poker players, as ﬂushes account for almost half of all hands dealt. What does this mean for you next time you're dealt a ﬂush? You're in good company!

Whether you're playing in a casino or online, ﬂushes are always a strong hand. In fact, statistics show that over the past few years, ﬂushes have become an increasingly common occurrence at the poker table. So what can you do to take advantage of this trend?

There's no doubt that having a ﬂush in your hand gives you a great chance of winning the pot. However, it's not always easy to know how to play a ﬂush correctly. That's why it's important to know what different situations call for.

Here are a few tips to help you make the most of your ﬂushes:

- If there are more than one player left in the pot, be aggressive and go all-in if you have a strong hand. This will force your opponents to fold their weaker hands, and could give you the win.
- If there's only one player left in the pot, try to keep the pot small by betting conservatively. You don't want to risk giving your opponent too much money when you already have such a strong hand.

Remember, with a flush in your hand, you're already in a very advantageous position. Use these tips to help you take home the winnings!

# 4. Record number of ﬂushes show that poker is still popular

In the ﬁrst quarter of 2018, there was a record number of ﬂushes – a total of 5.4 million. This indicates that poker is still popular among players, even in the current market conditions.

The record number of ﬂushes is especially notable because it comes at a time when the global poker market is going through a downturn. The amount of money being wagered on poker tournaments has decreased by around 20% in the past year, according to figures from research company Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

However, this has not impacted the popularity of poker among players. In fact, the number of people playing poker has remained relatively stable in recent years. There were 457 million online poker hands played in 2017, up from 452 million in 2016, according to data from PokerScout.com.

The record number of ﬂushes shows that there is still a strong appetite for the game among players. This suggests that the global poker market may have hit bottom and could start to rebound in the coming years.

# 5. Online poker ﬂushes reach an all-time high

There were a record number of online poker ﬂushes in the month of February, according to a report by Poker Flush.

This was the result of increased competition among online poker players, as well as changes in the game’s rules that made ﬂushes more valuable.

The average value of a ﬂush increased by 3.6%, while the number of ﬂushes hit an all-time high.

The average pot size also reached an all-time high, with players betting an average of $176 on each hand.
