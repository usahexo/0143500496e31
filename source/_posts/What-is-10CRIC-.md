#  What is 10CRIC? 

10CRIC is a project that uses the bitcoin blockchain to create a global, censorship-resistant digital asset registry. The project aims to provide an easy way for people to register and securely store digital assets without the need for a third party.

The team behind 10CRIC is working on a variety of features that will make it easy for people to use the platform. These features include a user-friendly interface, support for multiple languages, and enhanced security features.

10CRIC is based on the bitcoin blockchain, which means that it is secure and censorship-resistant. The bitcoin blockchain is tamper-proof, meaning that it cannot be modified without being detected. This makes it ideal for storing valuable digital assets.

The 10CRIC team plans to release a public beta in early 2019. Anyone will be able to register and store their digital assets on the platform using just a few clicks.

#  What does Dickens mean? 

Dickens was born Charles John Huffam Dickens on 7 February 1812, in Portsmouth, England. He died on 9 June 1870, aged 58. 

Dickens is one of the most acclaimed authors in English literature and many consider him the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works are celebrated for their humour, irony, social commentary and keen observation of human nature.

Despite his success as an author, Dickens' life was plagued by personal tragedy. His father was imprisoned for debt and his mother and siblings were sent to a workhouse. This experience would later form the basis of his novel “Oliver Twist”.

Dickens had a difficult childhood which only worsened when his family was forced to leave London and live in poverty in Marshalsea Prison due to his father's financial troubles. This experience would later form the basis of his novel “Little Dorrit”. 

Dickens married Catherine Hogarth in 1836 and the couple had 10 children together, but only four survived into adulthood. Tragically, Catherine herself died in 1858 after contracting pneumonia following a childbirth. Dickens was so devastated by her death that he fell into a deep depression and stopped writing completely for six months. 

Despite these personal tragedies, Dickens continued to produce some of the most beloved novels in English literature including “David Copperfield”, “A Tale of Two Cities” and “Great Expectations”.

So what does Dickens mean? In short, Dickens means brilliance. He was a master of humour, irony and social commentary who produced some of the most beloved novels in English literature. He also endured great personal tragedy throughout his life but continued to write until his death.
