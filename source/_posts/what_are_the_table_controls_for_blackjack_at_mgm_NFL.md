# What Are the Table Controls for Blackjack at MGM: An Overview for NFL Fans

MGM is one of the world's leading hospitality and entertainment companies, and their casinos are known for offering a wide variety of table games, including blackjack. Blackjack is a popular casino game that requires a mix of skill and luck to win. If you're an NFL fan who wants to try your hand at blackjack at MGM, it's essential to understand the table controls. In this article, we will provide an overview of the table controls for blackjack at MGM.

## The Basics of Blackjack

Before we dive into the table controls, let's review the basics of blackjack. In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards, and they have the option to "hit" and receive additional cards or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer also receives two cards, but one card is face down.

The value of the cards in blackjack is as follows:

- Ace: 1 or 11
- 2-10: face value
- Jack, Queen, King: 10

If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose the game. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins the game. If both the player and dealer have hands that are less than or equal to 21, the one with the highest hand value wins.

## The Table Controls for Blackjack at MGM

At MGM, the table controls for blackjack may vary depending on the table and location, but generally, the following controls are available:

- **Bet Size**: The minimum and maximum bet size is displayed on the table. Players must place their bets within these limits.
- **Hit/Stand**: Players indicate whether they want to hit or stand by using hand gestures or verbal cues.
- **Double Down**: Players may choose to double down on their initial two-card hand by placing an additional bet of equal value. In this case, they receive only one additional card.
- **Split**: If a player's initial two-card hand contains two cards of the same rank, they may choose to split the hand into two separate hands by placing an additional bet of equal value.
- **Insurance**: If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, players may choose to take insurance by placing an additional bet of half their original bet. If the dealer has blackjack, the insurance bet pays 2:1.
