The new owners have big plans for the property and are promising a complete renovation. This will include a new casino floor, updated rooms and a brand new pool area.

They are also pledging to make the Dicken's more family friendly and to attract more convention business. This is good news for Las Vegas as it continues to compete with other major tourist destinations like Orlando and Miami.
