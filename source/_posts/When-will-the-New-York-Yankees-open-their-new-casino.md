#  Will they do a soft opening or a grand opening?
At times, small businesses question whether they should do a soft opening before their grand opening. This is especially common with restaurants that are either new or have been remodeled. A soft opening is when you open your doors to the public but don't advertise it. You may offer reduced prices or complimentary items to entice people in. A grand opening is when you have a big bash and invite everyone you know. So which is better for your small business?

There's no definitive answer, as it depends on a variety of factors including your budget, your marketing strategy, and the type of business you have. However, here are some pros and cons of each to help you make a decision:

Soft Openings 

+ Can help build anticipation for your business 
+ May be less costly than a grand opening 
- Might not generate as much buzz as a grand opening 
- Could be seen as less important than the grand opening

Grand Openings 

+ Can create a lot of hype and excitement around your business 
+ Often generate more leads and customers than a soft opening 
- Can be more expensive than a soft opening 
- Requires advance planning
