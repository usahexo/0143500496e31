#  New Jersey Sports Gambling is a Hit, Cowboys Fans are Loving It!

The New Jersey sports gambling market is off to a blazing start. The state’s casinos and racetracks took in $323 million in bets during its first full month of operation, August.

That was more than triple the amount wagered in July, when the sportsbooks first opened in New Jersey.

And it’s no wonder Cowboys fans are loving it! They have already cashed in on their team’s hot start to the season, with the Cowboys now sitting at 3-0.

Cowboys fans accounted for nearly 10% of all the money wagered on NFL games in New Jersey in August.

Not surprisingly, the Jets and Giants were also among the most popular teams to bet on, both finishing the month with a record of 1-2.

The success of New Jersey’s sports gambling industry is good news for casino operators like Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, which have been eagerly awaiting its launch.

Both companies have made big investments in anticipation of New Jersey becoming a regulated sports betting market, including building new sportsbooks at their Atlantic City casinos.

The NFL season is in full swing and that means big business for the sportsbooks in New Jersey! legalized sports betting was launched in the state back in June and Gamblers have wasted no time in throwing down bets.

According to a recent report from the Associated Press, Cowboys games have generated the most legal bets in New Jersey. The Dallas Cowboys are currently leading the NFC East division with a record of 3-2.

Cowboys fans are certainly excited about the team’s prospects this season and they are showing their support by betting on their favorite players. In fact, Cowboys games account for nearly one-third of all the legal bets placed in New Jersey so far this year.

Cowboys games have generated nearly $3 million worth of legal bets in New Jersey. That figure is more than twice as much as any other team in the NFL. The Philadelphia Eagles, who are second on the list, have generated only $1.4 million worth of bets.

The amount of money being wagered on NFL games is sure to increase as we get closer to the playoffs. Sports betting is becoming increasingly popular throughout the United States and it looks like New Jersey is leading the way when it comes to legalized wagering on sports events.

#  Delaware Sports Betting Takes Off, Cowboys Lead in Legal Wagers!

Delaware sports betting is off to a hot start, with the Dallas Cowboys leading in legal wagers.

The Cowboys are followed by the Philadelphia Phillies, Golden State Warriors, and the Boston Celtics.

In total, Delaware sportsbooks have taken in more than $1 million in bets since they opened their doors on June 5th.

Interestingly, the state’s casinos have seen far more action than their racetracks. This is likely due to the fact that casino bettors can wager on a wider variety of sports than those at the racetracks.

“People are definitely interested in betting on sports here in Delaware,” said Anthony Cordaro, a spokesman for Dover Downs Hotel & Casino. “We’ve seen a pretty even mix of people placing bets both at the casino and through our online product.”

Some of the biggest individual bets have come on baseball games. The most expensive bet so far was a $1,500 wager on the Yankees -140 over the Orioles.

Delaware joins New Jersey as the only states with legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in May. Several other states, including Pennsylvania and West Virginia, are expected to join them in the near future.

#  Nevada Sports Betting Continues to Grow, Cowboys Still Favorite for Legal Wagers!

In the state of Nevada, sports betting continues to grow in popularity.Nevada has been a leader in legalized gambling for many years, and sports betting is no exception. In fact, according to a report from the Associated Press, this form of gambling brought in over $250 million in revenue in 2017.

That’s not too bad when you consider that the Football Bowl Championship (FBS) only generated $227.5 million in total revenue last year. Clearly, sports betting is a big deal in Nevada, and it doesn’t seem to be going away any time soon.

Interestingly enough, the Dallas Cowboys are still the favorite team for legal wagers in Nevada. This is despite the fact that they failed to make it to the playoffs last season. In fact, the Cowboys are followed by the New England Patriots, the Green Bay Packers, and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

It will be interesting to see if these rankings change at all as we move closer to the start of the new NFL season. In any case, it’s clear that sports betting is a big business in Nevada, and it doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon!

#  New York Sports Betting Surges Ahead, Cowboys Lead in Legally Placed Bets!

The Cowboys have surged ahead in the NFL when it comes to legally placed bets. This is according to data released by the state’s Gaming Commission this week.

The Cowboys currently have almost twice as many bets placed on them as any other team. The Jets, Giants, and Bills all tied for second place, each with about 100 more bets than any other NFL squad.

Interestingly, the Mets lead all professional sports teams in New York when it comes to legal wagers. This is despite the fact that they are coming off a disappointing season and failed to make the playoffs.

It’s not clear why this is the case, but one theory is that the Mets are seen as a bit of a longshot by some gamblers. The Yankees, who are also coming off a bad season, rank only sixth in terms of legal bets.

New York has seen a surge in sports betting in recent years, thanks in part to the legalization of gambling on individual games. This has allowed people to bet on games both at physical locations and online.

The amount of money being gambled on sports continues to grow rapidly. In 2017, $5 billion was wagered on sports in New York state alone. This number is expected to grow even further in 2019.
