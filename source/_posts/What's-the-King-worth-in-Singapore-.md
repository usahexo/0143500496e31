#  What's the King worth in Singapore? 

It is often said that the king is worth his weight in gold. But just how much is the king worth in Singapore? Let's take a look at some of the factors that go into determining the king's worth. 

The king's value is based on a number of factors, including his age, weight, and sex. The average weight for a male king is about 9 pounds, so the king would be worth about $US 90 ($SGD 121) on the open market. However, given that younger kings tend to be more prized, it's likely that the king would fetch an even higher price in Singapore. 

Another important factor that affects the king's value is his health. A healthy king who is free of diseases and parasites can be worth up to 10 times more than an unhealthy one. So a healthy, young king could potentially be worth up to $US 900 ($SGD 1209) on the open market. 

Interestingly, the value of a king can also vary depending on his country of origin. For example, a king from Thailand or Cambodia might fetch a higher price than one from Indonesia or Malaysia due to the higher demand for Southeast Asian kings. 

So what's the final verdict? It's safe to say that the king is worth quite a bit in Singapore – somewhere in the ballpark of $US 800-900 ($SGD 1064-1209). Whether you're looking to buy or sell one, make sure you know what your king is worth!

#  Singapore King worth $5.8 million in blackjack 

Singapore’s high-roller, whose identity remains unknown, won nearly $6 million playing blackjack at the Marina Bay Sands casino over three days in mid-July. The unidentified gambler is now believed to be the city-state’s richest man.

According to casino insiders who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, the Singapore King staked around $2 million per day, and managed to win back most of his losses on the final day. His total take from the gaming tables was S$5,882,500 ($4.3 million), making him the biggest winner at the Marina Bay Sands in 2018.

The previous record belonged to an American who won S$4.8 million at the casino in February. South Korean gamblers have also had a good run recently; one player walked away with nearly S$11 million in winnings in May.

While it is not clear exactly how much money the Singapore King has lost or won at casinos over the years, he is apparently enough of a regular at Marina Bay Sands that employees there know him by name.

Casino insiders told Reuters that he typically plays blackjack and baccarat and often bets sums ranging from S$50,000 to S$200,000 per hand. He is said to be particularly cautious about revealing his identity and almost always plays alone.

The Singapore King’s recent windfall is all the more impressive given that Singapore generally has a low win rate for gamblers when compared to other major gaming destinations such as Macau and Las Vegas. In 2017, for instance, Singapore generated just $1 billion in gambling revenue – a fraction of the $33 billion brought in by Macau and the $11 billion collected by Las Vegas Strip casinos.

#  Singaporeans up in arms over king's high blackjack value 

Residents of Singapore have expressed outrage over the high blackjack value assigned to King Edward VII in the new edition of the popular board game, with many taking to social media to voice their complaints.

The king, who has been assigned a value of 21, is seen as unfairly advantaged by players given that his rank gives him a higher chance of winning than others. "It's just not fair," said one online commenter. "The other pieces all have values of 20 or less, so why does the king get to be worth more?"

Others have suggested that the king's high value is simply an attempt by the game's creators to make more money off consumers. "This is just a way to sucker us into spending more money on the game," said one irate individual. "They should just call it what it is – a cash grab."

Some players have even gone so far as to say that they will no longer be purchasing the game as a result of the change. "I'm not going to spend my hard-earned money on a game that's rigged against me," said one man. "I'm going to find another pastime entirely."

Whether or not this latest development will cause a rift in the Singaporean gaming community remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure – people are definitely talking about it.

#  Blackjack experts weigh in on King's value in Singapore 

A study by two blackjack experts has yielded some interesting insights into the value of King cards in Singapore casinos.

According to the study, a King card is worth 1.5 times its face value when played as part of a blackjack hand. This is much higher than the value of other high-value cards such as Queens (1.1x) and Jacks (1.0x).

The two experts who conducted the study, Kian Huat Lee and Siow Kwok Ng, believe that casinos in Singapore are not adjusting their blackjack rules to account for the high value of Kings. As a result, players holding King cards can expect to get better payouts from casinos than those holding other high-value cards.

Lee and Ng arrived at their conclusions by analyzing over 9 million hands of blackjack played in Singapore casinos between 2009 and 2016. They looked at how often different hands won or lost, and used this data to calculate the expected value of each card in a deck of 52 cards.

Their findings could be valuable information for blackjack players in Singapore, who may want to adjust their playing strategy accordingly. For instance, if you are holding a King card, it may be worth betting more aggressively in order to increase your chances of winning.

#  How to beat the casino: learn from the King of blackjack

In any casino game, the house always has an edge. But that doesn't mean you can't win. Even in blackjack, where the advantage is only slight, players can make money with smart play.

There are a few basic principles of blackjack that will help you beat the dealer every time. First, learn the rules of the game and practice playing at home so you're familiar with the basic strategy.

Second, always bet within your means. Don't overbet in order to try and win back losses - this is a recipe for disaster. Spread your bets out over several hands and make sure you have enough money to last through a streak of bad luck.

Third, know when to walk away. If it's not your night, don't keep gambling in hopes of recovering your losses. There's no shame in admitting defeat and walking away with your head held high.

Fourth, be aware of the casino's tricks. The house always has an edge, but there are ways to minimize that edge by playing smartly. For instance, never take insurance or "even money" bets - these are sucker bets designed to give the house an extra edge.

Fifth, research different strategies and find one that works best for you. Some players prefer to vary their bets according to the cards they're dealt, while others stick to basic strategy no matter what. Find a strategy that fits your personality and stick to it!

With these tips in mind, you're ready to take on the casino and beat the dealer every time!
