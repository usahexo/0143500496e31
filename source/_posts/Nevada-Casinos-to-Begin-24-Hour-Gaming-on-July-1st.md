#  Nevada Casinos to Begin 24-Hour Gaming on July 1st

The casinos of Nevada will be starting 24-hour gaming on July 1st, in order to stay competitive with the casinos of New Jersey and Delaware. This move is expected to generate an additional $100 million in annual revenue for the state's casinos.

Supporters of the measure say that it is necessary in order to keep up with other states, while opponents believe that it will lead to more gambling addiction and social problems. However, there is evidence that extended hours actually lead to increased patron spending and decreased casino employee turnover rates.

This new policy is likely to have a major impact on the tourism industry in Nevada, as tourists will now be able to gamble around the clock. It is also likely to create new opportunities for employment in the casino industry.

#  First Casino in Connecticut Opens its Doors to Gamblers at 6am

The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe opened the doors of its new $200 million Foxwoods Resort Casino at 6am this morning, becoming the first casino in Connecticut.

Some 2,000 people were waiting in line when the casino opened, and many more are expected to visit in the coming weeks. The 33-acre complex includes a hotel, a golf course, and a variety of restaurants.

"This is it," said one woman as she walked into the casino. "My husband is going to kill me."

Gamblers can choose from among 2,000 slot machines and 110 table games, including blackjack, roulette and craps. The poker room is among the largest in the country, with 50 tables.

The opening of Foxwoods Resort Casino marks the latest chapter in a decades-long dispute between the state of Connecticut and two Indian tribes over gambling rights. In 1991, the state reached an agreement with the Mashantucket Pequots to allow limited gambling at their reservation. The Mohegan Tribe later reached a similar agreement with the state.

Both tribes have since built large casinos on their reservations. Foxwoods Resort Casino is by far the largest, dwarfing its nearest competitor, Mohegan Sun, which has just 1,000 slot machines.

Connecticut officials had been pushing for years for the tribes to open casinos off their reservations, but the tribes successfully fought off all attempts to do so. In 1995, they won a landmark ruling from the United States Supreme Court upholding their right to operate casinos on Indian land.

#  Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City to Start Allowing Gambling at 8am

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City will start allowing gambling at 8am starting on July 1st, 2019. This change is in response to a new state law that will allow casinos to open at 8am.

Before the change, the casino only allowed gambling from 11am to 7pm. The new hours will be from 8am to 4am.

"We are excited to offer our guests more opportunities to enjoy all that our property has to offer," said Liza Cartmell, President of the Atlantic City Alliance.

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is one of nine casinos in Atlantic City. It has nearly 2,500 slot machines and 130 table games.

#  Rhode Island's Two Commercial Casinos Can Start Gambling at 9am

The Rhode Island Supreme Court has ruled that the state's two commercial casinos can start gambling at 9am instead of 11am, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.

Ocean Resort Casino and Twin River Casino had both sought the earlier start time. The court ruled that the earlier start time does not violate the state constitution's prohibition against lotteries.

Supporters of the earlier start time say it would better compete with casinos in Massachusetts, which are allowed to open at 8am. Opponents say it would lead to more problem gambling.

#  MGM Springfield Opens Its Doors at 10am, allowing gambling

The long awaited MGM Springfield casino has finally opened in western Massachusetts. The new establishment allows for gambling starting at 10am, with a gaming floor of 125,000 square feet. The $960 million project which began construction in 2016 has already created over 1,000 jobs.

The opening of MGM Springfield also coincides with the repeal of the stateâ€™skk slots-only law. This will pave the way for MGM to offer table games, including blackjack and poker, as well as sports betting. Massachusetts is one of six states that currently offers legal sports betting, with mobile wagering to be launched in the near future.

MGM Springfield spokesperson Sari Beliak said that table games and sports betting are expected to account for about half of casino revenues. This is similar to what is seen at other casinos across the country. Slot machines are still expected to be the primary means of generating revenue, accounting for about two-thirds of income.

Beliak also noted that there is plenty of interest in the new facility from people in Connecticut and Rhode Island, both of which have casinos but no sports books. She said that many people are crossing state lines to place bets at MGM Springfield given its proximity to these states.

The new casino has already proven to be a boon for the local economy, with businesses near the casino reporting increased traffic and sales. Restaurants have been especially busy as people have been looking for places to eat near the casino. Local resident Megan Mathews said that she is excited about having a casino in her backyard and looks forward to trying out some of the new table games.
