#  King is usually what in blackjack explores the inner workings of John Updike's mind

In 1991, John Updike published the novel "King of the Hill." The novel is set in Texas in the 1930s and tells the story of a young boy, Bobby, as he grows up and comes of age.

One of the central themes of the novel is Bobby's struggle to find his place in the world. He is constantly competing with his older brother, Henry, for his father's approval. Bobby is also trying to figure out who he is and what he wants to do with his life.

The novel is full of richly drawn characters and vivid images. Updike does an excellent job of bringing 1930s Texas to life. He captures both the beauty and the violence of that time and place.

Many reviewers praised "King of the Hill" when it was first published. It was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, but it did not win. However, over time it has come to be seen as one of Updike's finest novels.

#  John Updike's latest novel is a meditation on kingship

Few authors have explored the nature of kingship as thoroughly as John Updike. His latest novel, "The Maples in the Moonlight," is a meditation on the subtle dynamics of power and monarchy.

Updike has always been fascinated by the ways in which people exercise authority over others. In his early novels, such as "The Rabbit Trilogy," he examined the dynamics of family life and suburban society. With "The Maples in the Moonlight," Updike turns his attention to the ancient institution of monarchy.

The novel follows the exploits of King Wilfred, a charming but flawed ruler who is coping with the challenges of his reign. Wilfred is surrounded by a cast of colorful supporting characters, including his loyal advisor Sir Bertram, his scheming queen Margot, and his unruly son Prince Hal.

As Wilfred struggles to maintain order in his kingdom, he must also contend with powerful forces that are threatenning to undermine him. A rival faction is plotting to overthrow him, and a mysterious malady is afflicting his subjects. Wilfred must also deal with personal crises, such as his troubled relationship with Margot and Hal's rebellious streak.

Through it all, Wilfred tries to stay true to himself and fulfil his destiny as king. He must find a way to balance his responsibilities to his people with his own needs and desires.

"The Maples in the Moonlight" is an absorbing exploration of one man's journey to find meaning in life. It shows that despite its many challenges, monarchy can be a rewarding way of governance. Updike's deft prose brings Wilfred and his world vividly to life, making for an engrossing reading experience.

#  King is usually what in blackjack: John Updike's most ambitious novel yet

When betting, the player can either bet against the dealer (making a "normal" bet), or make a special bet called an insurance bet. If the dealer has blackjack (an Ace and any ten-value card), the player with blackjack wins even money on their normal bet, but loses the insurance bet. If the dealer does not have blackjack, the player still loses the insurance bet, and continues play as normal.

Insurance bets are usually not a good idea; they are only profitable under very specific circumstances. The player needs to have more than half their original bet at risk in order to make an insurance bet profitable.

#  John Updike reinvents the king in king is usually what in blackjack

In the game of blackjack, there are a few things you can count on. The dealer hitting on 17. The player standing on anything less than 17. And the fact that, no matter what, at some point in the game the king is going to show up.

Unless you're playing at John Updike's blackjack table.

There, the king isn't your usual invincible monarch. He can be beaten. In fact, he often is. And that's all part of the fun.

Updike, who has been playing blackjack for more than 50 years, came up with his own variation on the game called "king is usually what." In it, the king is exactly that – usually what. That means he can be beaten just like any other card in the deck. But here's the catch: you can only beat him if you have another king in your hand.

"It makes it more interesting," Updike says of his variation. "It's not just a card game where you try to get 21 or as close to 21 as you can."

Updike first started playing king is usually what about 10 years ago, and since then it's caught on among players around the world. There are now tournaments and championships featuring the game, and even an iPhone app that allows players to compete online.

So how do you play? It's pretty simple. The dealer deals out two cards to each player and two cards to himself, one face up and one face down. The face-up card is turned over and becomes the trump card – in other words, the card that can't be beaten by any other card in the deck (unless someone happens to have another king). The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (or Bust).

If you're playing against someone else and they have a king, you can still beat them by getting closer to 21 than they did with their two cards combined. If both players have kings, then whoever has the higher-value trump card wins (assuming neither player goes Bust). If there's a tie, then it's a draw.

One important thing to note: unlike regular blackjack, you don't want to stand on a number that totals 10 or 11 if the face-up trump card is a 10 or an ace (since those cards can still be beaten by another player). In Updike's game, it's better to take another card in order to try and get closer to 21 than your opponent.

And if you're lucky enough to get two kings? You're automatically declared the winner – no matter what your opponent has got going on."
