This means that people who have gambling disorder are also likely to have other mental health disorders.</p>
<p>Some of the most common mental health disorders that are comorbid with gambling disorder include the following:</p>
<p>depression<br>alcoholism<br>drug addiction<br>borderline personality disorder<br>eating disorders<br>post-traumatic stress disorder<br>schizophrenia<br>obsessive-compulsive disorder</p>
<h1 id="Comorbidity-of-gambling-disorder-and-other-mental-health-disorders-3-How-common-is-comorbidity-between-gambling-disorder-and-other-mental-health-disorders"><a href="#Comorbidity-of-gambling-disorder-and-other-mental-health-disorders-3-How-common-is-comorbidity-between-gambling-disorder-and-other-mental-health-disorders" class="headerlink" title="Comorbidity of gambling disorder and other mental health disorders.3. How common is comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders?"></a>Comorbidity of gambling disorder and other mental health disorders.3. How common is comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders?</h1><p>It is estimated that comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders is quite common. In fact, a study published in the journal “Addiction” in 2013 found that comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders was present in more than half of the study participants.</p>
<p>There are many different factors that can contribute to the development of comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders. Some of these factors may include genetics, environmental influences, and personality traits.</p>
<p>There are a number of different mental health disorders that are commonly seen alongside gambling disorder. The most common of these disorders include major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is often referred to as a “hidden addiction” because its symptoms can be subtle and easily hidden from loved ones or friends. This can make it difficult for people with gambling disorder to seek help for their condition.</p>
<p>The majority of people with gambling disorder also have another mental health disorder. This makes it even more important for people who are at risk for developing gambling disorder to be screened for other mental health conditions.</p>
<h1 id="4-What-are-the-other-mental-health-disorders-that-are-most-commonly-comorbid-with-gambling-disorder"><a href="#4-What-are-the-other-mental-health-disorders-that-are-most-commonly-comorbid-with-gambling-disorder" class="headerlink" title="4. What are the other mental health disorders that are most commonly comorbid with gambling disorder?"></a>4. What are the other mental health disorders that are most commonly comorbid with gambling disorder?</h1><p>There are a few other mental health disorders that are most commonly comorbid with gambling disorder. These include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</li>
<li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that these disorders are not only comorbid with gambling disorder, but also with one another. For example, people with ADHD are more likely to also have problems with gambling, as well as problems with alcohol and drug abuse. Similarly, people with bipolar disorder are more likely to have problems with gambling, as well as suicidal thoughts or attempts.</p>
<p>Depression is also common in people who have gambling disorder. In fact, a recent study found that depression was present in nearly half of all people who had a problem with gambling. This may be because people with depression often turn to gambling as a way to try and make themselves feel better. Unfortunately, this usually just leads to further problems.</p>
<p>Finally, OCD is also relatively common among people who have gambling disorder. This may be because people with OCD often have problems making decisions and tend to be very perfectionistic. This can lead them to gamble in an attempt to gain control over the outcome of the game. However, as we know, gambling is never under someone’s control and can therefore be very frustrating and demoralizing for those who suffer from OCD.</p>
<h1 id="5-What-are-the-effects-of-comorbidity-between-gambling-disorder-and-other-mental-health-disorders"><a href="#5-What-are-the-effects-of-comorbidity-between-gambling-disorder-and-other-mental-health-disorders" class="headerlink" title="5. What are the effects of comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders?"></a>5. What are the effects of comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders?</h1><p>Comorbidity is when someone experiences two or more disorders or illnesses at the same time. Comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders is common.</p>
<p>Studies have found that 60 to 80 percent of people with gambling disorder also have another mental health disorder. The most common comorbid disorders are mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p>People with comorbid gambling disorder and another mental health disorder are more likely to have a severe form of gambling disorder and experience more negative consequences from their gambling behavior, such as financial problems, family conflict, and job loss. They are also more likely to seek treatment for their gambling problem.</p>
<p>The effects of comorbidity between gambling disorder and other mental health disorders can be complex. It is not always clear which condition is causing the symptoms or which condition should be treated first. Treatment for both conditions is often needed.</p>
<p>Some treatments that may help include:</p>
<p>– Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating both gambling disorder and the other mental health disorder</p>
<p>– Medication for treating mood disorders or anxiety disorders</p>
<p>– Support groups for people with comorbid gambling disorder and other mental health disorders</p>
